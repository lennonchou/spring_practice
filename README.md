Demonstrates the capabilities of the Spring MVC web framework through small, simple examples.
After reviewing this showcase, you should have a good understanding of what Spring MVC can do and get a feel for how easy it is to use.
Includes project code along with a supporting slideshow and screen cast.

In this showcase you'll see the following in action:

* The simplest possible @Controller
* Mapping Requests
* Obtaining Request Data
* Generating Responses
* Message Converters
* Rendering Views
* Type Conversion
* Validation
* Forms
* File Upload

Note:
-------------------

This showcase originated from a [blog post](http://blog.springsource.com/2010/07/22/spring-mvc-3-showcase/) and was adapted into a SpringOne presentation called [Mastering MVC 3](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mastering-Spring-MVC-3).

A screen cast showing the showcase in action is [available in QuickTime format](http://s3.springsource.org/MVC/mvc-showcase-screencast.mov).
